# PokemonGo Patcher


### About 

This tweak contains two parts: 

* Fake location
* Bypass jailbreak detection

### Fake Location

This part is based on [PokemonHook](https://github.com/rpplusplus/PokemonHook) tweak and reimplement in theos logos.

DEBIAN package is available on my Cydia repo: [https://cydia.hiraku.tw](https://cydia.hiraku.tw)

### Bypass Jailbreak Detection

This part contains two parts, too.

* Objective-C method swizzling: prevent app from crashing.
* C function swizzling: make the app can connect to server.
